# Upgrade

The `upgrade` role is used to kick off the Leapp OS upgrade on the target host. During the execution of this task, the host will be rebooted more than once. After the Leapp OS upgrade is finished, the role will perform some basic validation tests to determine if the OS was upgraded successfully.

## Role variables
